## Logging

The logger name for the library is `"signalbot"`.
It does not have any handlers attached, for convenience the [signalbot.enable_console_logging][] function is provided.

## Persistent storage

By default the storage attribute of the [signalbot.SignalBot][] class is in-memory.
Any changes are lost when the bot is stopped or reseted.
For persistent storage to disk, check the SQLite or Redis storage [page](./examples/bot_config_options.md#storage-type-options).
